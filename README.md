# Hotel Review App

## Getting Started
To start app fork and clone repository. In a terminal run bundle install to install necessary files. Cd into client and run ```npm install``` to install React dependencies. Navigate back up to main path. Run rails db:migrate db:seed to run the current migrations and seed some example Hotels. (The app will work without the pre-seeded hotels if you do not prefer them.) You can then run rails s to start the local server. It is hosted in localhost:3000. In a separate terminal run npm start --prefix client. This runs the react app hosted on localhost:4000.

## Ready To Go
Currently the app is only hosted locally so all users and interaction will be made, edited, and deleted by you. Make some reviews and see how information is shared between components and served by server. Will update soon to be online.
